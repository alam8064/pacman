# Solving Pacman via Reinforcement Learning
This Pacman Project is done with regards to the module CS3243, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

## Objectives
- Familiarise with the reinforcement learning.
- Implement a Q-learning agent as well as an approximate Q-learning agent and train them to play the game of Pacman (qLearningAgents.py).
- Implement and customize a feature extractor for the Pacman game in order to maximize the score and win rate of the agent (featureExtractors.py).
